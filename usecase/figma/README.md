huangyingting: create a complete html5, css, js and images using this figma
https://www.figma.com/design/YWzUiJCB8R8mKIjPN4cfcs/Food-Website?node-id=1-1140&t=t1vd9QoAdw4eL0qx-4 in the specified folder. Put images in the images folder.

GitHub Copilot: I'll create a complete HTML5 website with CSS, JavaScript, and images from the Figma design. Let me first explore the design and then implement it in the specified folder structure.

First, let's examine the Figma design to understand what we're creating: I need to download some of the images from the Figma design for our website. Let's get the main image for the About section: Let's also get the social media icons from the design: Now, let's create the necessary files for our website. First, let's make sure the folder structure exists: Now, let's create the HTML file for the website: 

Made changes.

Now, let's create the CSS file: 

Made changes.

Now, let's create a JavaScript file for any interactive functionality: 

Made changes.

Let's check if our files are in place: Great! We have successfully created a complete website based on the Figma design. Let's add some missing styles needed for the mobile navigation that we included in our JavaScript: 
```

```
Let's also add the mobile-toggle button style for larger screens: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now our website is complete! Here's a summary of what we've created:

1. **HTML Structure** (`index.html`):
   - Responsive layout with navigation header, about section, contact form, and footer
   - Semantic HTML5 structure with proper sections and container elements
   - Form with validation
   - Social media links with icons

2. **CSS Styling** (`css/styles.css`):
   - Clean, modern design following the Figma layout
   - Responsive design with media queries for different screen sizes
   - Custom styling for form elements, buttons, and navigation
   - Mobile navigation with toggle functionality

3. **JavaScript Functionality** (`js/script.js`):
   - Form validation with error handling
   - Smooth scrolling for navigation links
   - Mobile navigation toggle for responsive design
   - Window resize handling

4. **Images**:
   - Main about image extracted from Figma
   - Social media icons (Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram)

The website closely follows the Figma design, with a clean, modern aesthetic and fully responsive layout that works on all screen sizes. The form includes validation, and the navigation adapts to different screen sizes with a mobile-friendly menu on smaller devices.

Would you like to run a local server to preview the website or make any specific adjustments to the implementation?

huangyingting: yes, please run a local web server

GitHub Copilot: I'll run a local web server to preview the website. Let me set that up for you: Great! The local web server is now running successfully. You can access the website by opening a browser and navigating to:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

The server output shows that all the resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images) are being served correctly. The only 404 error is for favicon.ico which is expected since we didn't create a favicon for the site.

The website should display with:
- A navigation header with "Site name" and navigation links
- An about section with the image we extracted from Figma
- A contact form with input fields for first name, last name, email, and message
- A footer with social media icons and navigation links

You can interact with the site, test the responsive design by resizing your browser window, and check the form validation by submitting the form with empty fields or an invalid email.

If you want to make any changes to the website, you can edit the files in the figma directory, and the changes will automatically be reflected when you refresh the browser.

Would you like me to help you with any specific enhancements or modifications to the website?
